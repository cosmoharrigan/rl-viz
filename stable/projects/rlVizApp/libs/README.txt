The developer of rl-viz have made use of the jgoodies forms package.  Their homepage is here:
http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/forms/index.html

It's distributed under a BSD license, and we really only use it as a library, so we didn't feel like including the source or anything else from the distribution, except the license file:
FORMS_JAR_LICENSE.txt
